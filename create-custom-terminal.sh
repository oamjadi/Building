#I made some modification to comment out the brew install part, and I downloaded iterm from the website so also commenting out that part.
#After doing this open iterm2, go to preferences, click on Profiles>Text, search the font SourceCodePro and in Colors import the deep blue color configuration and then select it and restart the terminal. 
In the future as I continue to customize my terminal I will add to this. Next I want to do more keymapping for my vim to be able to code faster.
